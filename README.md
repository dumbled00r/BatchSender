## Introduction

This is a webpage that I created for minimizing time and saving up gas fees sending multiple transactions.

For the most, I used Disperse.app's contracts!

Here is their website:
[Disperse.app](https://disperse.app/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
